i need you to continue this static html/css/js page that displays news headlines on fullscreen, in a container div with flex divided into four columns. 

at any moment, there will be four headlines on each of these columns called from javascript arrays imported with script tag on the body. 

each group of headlines will be shown on the screen for a set amount of time.

all the arrays have the same amount of news headlines. when the script runs out of headlines to display, loop back to the first one.

please separate the css and js file for ease of maintenance. make it so that i can modify the duration of interval between switching the headlines.
